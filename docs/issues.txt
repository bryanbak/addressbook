# Issues
Ran into a networking issue while working on Sprint 3 that I didn't have time to resolve.
I tried putting client and server directories within src and making a Dockerfile in each new dir
so that I could have them totally separate in their own containers. Something like:

src
	client
		app.py
		Dockerfile
	server
		Dockerfile
		server.py
		AddressEntry.py
		backend
			csv.py
			
The server.py file was a simple Flask app with a search function. I removed the CsvBackend code from
the app.py in client and replaced it with an HTTPClient that made api calls to the Flask server.

I was able to get it all working locally with my Docker toolbox setup, but when I sent it to a friend
with a more legit docker setup on a Mac he wasn't able to get the client to make calls to the webserver
without the connection being refused.
